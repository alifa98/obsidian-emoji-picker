# Emoji Picker plugin for Obsidian

This plugin adds a button to the editor toolbar that opens a modal with a searchable emoji picker. Clicking an emoji inserts it at the cursor position in the editor.

You can also set a hotkey to open the emoji picker. 
The recommended hotkey is `Ctrl+.`, but you can set it to any key combination you like.

## Emoji Version

As of November 2024, we are using the emoji-mart library so the emoji version is [14](https://emojipedia.org/emoji-14.0/).
